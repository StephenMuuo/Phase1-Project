# Phase1-Project
# Assessing Aircraft Risk for New Aviation Division

# Business problem
Your company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. You must then translate your findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

# Data
The data is from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.

# Goal
To identify which aircrafts are the lowest risk for the company.
